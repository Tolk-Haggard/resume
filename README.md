#### 2001–2008 Hortica Edwardsville, IL
#### Application Architect

- Designed and implemented a system with allowed our claims department to operate totally paperless. This saved resources in paper management and storage as well as streamlined work flows and allowed us to significantly lower our Xerox printing contracts.
- Modeled and implemented several changes to a database schema for a complex rating application to allow for more normalized storage of policy information.
- Designed and populated a data warehouse for our policy rating system. This allowed managers to examine initiatives for effectiveness and trends for possible underwriting flaws.
- Designed an Oracle system to manage and track all of the company’s reinsurance activities as well as provide the billing reports to recover money from our reinsurers.
- Lead the company in a conversion from an OpenVMS system to Oracle Portal. This allowed the company to save money on support for outdated servers as well as leverage new web based technologies.
- Designed user interfaces for Portal in custom PSPs, HTML and JavaScript. This allowed IT to sync up network, application server, and database password so users were required to only remember one password instead of having to keep track of three.
- Wrote a PSP application that gathered user input and ran reports or database update based on those parameters. This application replaced over 1000 DCL applications with only a few PL/SQL procedures.
- Maintained COBOL applications for nightly processing. I was in charge of coming up with standards for converting our COBOL applications from Dec COBOL to Fujitsu standard COBOL.
- Created standards for using PERL to replace DCL file processing and wrote packages containing several utilities used in virtually all of our PERL scripts. I taught myself PERL and then trained several others to code scripts, which allowed the company to leverage this powerful language with no additional cost to the training budget.
- Wrote VB applications to handle distribution of reports and versioning of old files. This allowed our company to become a 100% windows shop without having to pay for expensive 3rd party archiving software and still retain the built in functionality that was provided on the OpenVMS platform we migrated from.
- Converted an existing company-wide imaging system to a new system which minimized load times and maximized monitor space usage, allowing users to use the imaging system much more efficiently.
- Wrote standards for testing initiatives and proper QA procedures. These procedures allowed for more effective and less time consuming testing of applications by our development staff. This was effective at saving development time, internal support time, and increased system stability.
- Participated in a team to help set standards to modularize code into database packages, procedures, and functions. This allowed for better code reuse, minimized maintenance, thinner client applications, and less dependency on third party tools.
- Trained several new members of our programming staff on our database structure, coding standards, and handling the programming helpdesk. I also held the department record for most user requests solved as a member of the programming helpdesk and created standards and best practice guidelines for handling the programming helpdesk.
- Handled the migration of the company’s Intranet systems from a legacy ASP system into Oracle Portal. This allowed for much more dynamic content and allowed user groups to even manage their own Intranet content.
- Designed and implemented a message board system to be used internally by the company. This allowed task force groups that were spread across the company to discuss important topics in large groups without interrupting regular work habits and without the usual meeting-scheduling overhead.
