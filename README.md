## Conference Speaker Experience
#### Agile Maine Day 2018 - Portland, ME
- Talk [Bootstrapping A Great Agile Team](http://www.agilemaineday.com/schedule/bootstrapping-a-great-agile-team/)
- Abstract: Great teams make great software products. Much of agile focuses on how to make existing teams better, but what are the best practices for starting a new team… and did I mention we have to have an MVP of our product out the door in about 4 months? Join me as I tell a tail of Red Bull fueled productivity, about how a team of five came together to apply the latest development practices, UI design, and technology into a product our users loved in just under 4 months time. I’ll cover our thoughts on Team size, Embedded UX, TDD, Angular, Redux, FP vs OOP, Product Ownership, ShuHaRi, Conway’s law, and cloud computing in AWS.

#### Agile Alliance Technical Conference 2017 - Boston, MA
- Talk: [Test Driven](https://aatc2017.sched.com/event/9PAw/test-driven-a-deep-dive-into-how-testing-shapes-code-brian-haggard?iframe=yes&w=100%&sidebar=yes&bg=no)
- Abstract: Test driven development gets its roots from XP and is a popular development practice in most agile circles. Tests help us gain confidence in the correctness of our code, so code that is driven by tests starts life with a good deal of confidence. Or at least that is the reason many people try out TDD in the first place. Instead of focusing on whether or not the promise of error-free code is fulfilled by test driven development or exploring if the added cost of writing tests is worth the additional time, I'd like to explore with the audience how tests and the mindset of the test writer shapes the code being tested. Come for lots of code samples as we explore some of the ways that testing shapes a codebase.
